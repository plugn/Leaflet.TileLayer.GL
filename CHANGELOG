# 1.0.1

* Switch to subclassing from `GridLayer` instead of `TileLayer` to properly
  handle async draws and remove glitching.
* Prettified filenames and updated refs in `package.json`.
* Fixed CRS coords orientation *again* because GL coords systems are insane.
* Linting.

# 1.0.0

* Initial release
* Three demos (mandelbrot, terrain-rbg, antitoner)
